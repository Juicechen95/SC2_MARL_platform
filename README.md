# SC2_MARL_platform
Based on https://github.com/inoryy/reaver-pysc2/tree/v1.0.

This platform is practical for MARL in StarCraft II, and has an architecture as presented in supplements/platform\ architecture.png. It allows unit-level control in a combat map. 

Note: a specific version of StarCraft II  (released before August, 2018) is required. Besides, this platform requires a modifed version of pysc2 in pysc2/.
